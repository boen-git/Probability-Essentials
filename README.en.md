This repository contains the exercises from the textbook "Probability Essentials" by Jean Jacod and Philip Protter, along with their solutions in Chinese. It includes the LaTeX source code and the compiled PDF files.
This textbook is of moderate difficulty and is suitable for graduate students or senior undergraduate students majoring in statistics to study.

When I was studying the *Advanced Probability* this semester, I couldn't find a complete set of solution manual for this textbook.
Therefore, I organized the solutions to some of the exercises in the book by myself.
This solution manual includes some of my own notes and the answers to **all** exercises **execpt** for the martingale parts.
I hope you enjoy reading them.

Due to limited time, some of the processes are rather breif. Your comments and corrections are welcome!
